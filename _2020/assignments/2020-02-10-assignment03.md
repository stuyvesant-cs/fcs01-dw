Create a home page for your account.
  * The top of the page should contain your name and class period.
  * Below that, the page should link to any html assignments you have done so far.
  * The page should be accessible by going to `http://homer.stuycs.org/~<YOUR USERNAME>`
to do this, name the file `index.html`
  * You may style it any way you'd like, you may also include other content as you see fit.
