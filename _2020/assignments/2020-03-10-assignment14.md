* Do the problems located here: <https://codingbat.com/home/dw@stuy.edu/strings-0>
* Only use the python features we have covered in class so far.
  * This means basic string operation, conditional statements and while loops. You do not need anything else for these functions. Stay away from outside internet resources, they will only lead to madness.
* In addition completing the problems on CodingBat, copy all the functions you write into a single .py file and submit that using the homework server.
