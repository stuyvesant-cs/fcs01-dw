Here are the first 3 depths of a variant of the "dragon fractal":

| depth = 0 | depth = 1 | depth = 2 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|![dragon0]({{"/assets/img/a28-0.png" | relative_url}}) |![dragon1]({{"/assets/img/a28-1.png" | relative_url}}) |![dragon2]({{"/assets/img/a28-2.png" | relative_url}})           |

* In the thid diagram, each dragon fractal with depth=1 is given a different color.

* Write a function: `dragon(t, depth, size)`
  * Turtle `t` should draw a dragon fractal with depth `depth` where each side is `size` length.
  * The process of drawing the dragon fractal is similar to the koch curve. First figure out what the steps are, it might help to draw your own.

* For reference, here is the result of `dragon(t, 6, 25)`. It took at least 5 minutes to draw (I stepped away from the computer).
