Here are the first 3 depths of a fractal tree (in order to draw it vertically I started by rotating the turlte 90 degrees outside the function):

| depth = 0 | depth = 1 | depth = 2 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|![tree0]({{"/assets/img/a29-0.png" | relative_url}}) |![tree1]({{"/assets/img/a29-1.png" | relative_url}}) |![tree2]({{"/assets/img/a29-2.png" | relative_url}})           |

* __Some important things to note about the tree__
  * The turtle ends in the starting position.
  * The turtle traces over itself when drawing parts of trees.
    * This means unlike yesterday's fractals, you do not have distict sub-trees each time.
    * Look at depth 2, the bases of the 2 upper trees are the branches for the bottom tree.
  * The angles used in rotation do not need to be as exact as yesterday's (when triangles were involved).

* Write a function: `tree(t, depth, size, angle)`
  * Turtle `t` should draw a fractal tree with depth `depth` where each side is `size` length.

Here are the first 3 depths of the Sierpinski triangle:

| depth = 0 | depth = 1 | depth = 2 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|![tri0]({{"/assets/img/a29-3.png" | relative_url}}) |![tri1]({{"/assets/img/a29-4.png" | relative_url}}) |![tri2]({{"/assets/img/a29-5.png" | relative_url}})           |

* __Some important things to note__
  * Like the tree, the turtle ends up back at the starting point, facing the starting direction.
  * The three imagages are all the same exact resolution, meaning that the oversall size of the shape doesn't get bigger with more depth, the inside gets more complex.
  * The vertices of each smaller triangle are placed halfway down the sides of the larger enclosing trianlge.
  * Here, I've set depth 0 to be a triangle instead of a stright line, I think this will make the code cleaner for you. Here is the traignle function I used:
    ```
    def triangle(t, length):
        t.fd(length)
        t.lt(120)
        t.fd(length)
        t.lt(120)
        t.fd(length)
        t.lt(120)
    ```
* Write a function: `sep_traingle(t, depth, size)`
  * Turtle `t` should draw a Sierpinski triangle with `depth`.
  * The `size` argument is the overall length of the entire fractal, regardless of depth.
    * This means that if `size = 300`, the whole fractal will be inside an equilateral tirangle where each side has a length of 300.
    * All three depths above are of size 300, but are obviously different on the inside.
