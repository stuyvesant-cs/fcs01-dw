# Write the following functions in python.
* 'draw_square'
  - Takes a turtle and a number as parameters.
  - Have the turtle draw a square with side length equal to the number parameter.
    - Exaple usage:
      ```
      leonardo = turtle.Turtle()
      draw_square(leonardo, 200)
      ```

* `draw_spiral0`
  - Write a funtion that draws a stright spiral given a turtle and the length of the initial side.
  - A stright spiral is a sprial like shape made of sides that are straight lines at 90 degree angles to each other. Each side is shorter than the previous side.
  - A square spiral might look like this: ![square spiral]({{"/assets/img/a27-0.png" | relative_url}})

* `draw_spiral1`
  - Write a more generic `spiral` function, that will make a turtle draw a sprial shape given an initial side length and the angle it should turn each time.

For reference, here's a list of basic `turtle` commands. They're here as comments so you can paste them to the top of your code, if desired.
```
#    t = turtle.Turtle() # make a new turlte
#    t.fd(<length>)
#        t.fd(100)
#    t.bk(<length>)
#        t.bk(100)
#    t.rt(<angle>)
#        t.rt(45)
#    t.lt(<length>)
#        t.lt(45)
#    t.position() # returns (x, y) coordinates of the turtle
#    t.setx(<x coordinate>)
#        t.setx(0)
#    t.sety(<y coordinate>)
#        t.sety(0)
#    t.color((<red>, <green>, <blue>))
#        t.color((255, 255, 0))
```
