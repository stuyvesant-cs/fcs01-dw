__This is a pair programming assignment. With your table buddy do the following:__

1. Go to <http://projecteuler.net/problems>
2. Solve problems 1, 6 and 5
3. If you've completed them, work on more.
4. Your completed assignment should have functions and tests in it.

Even though you are working in pairs, you should each individually submit your work.

The functions you write should return the answer.
Important notes:
  * Some of these problems are simple, many of them are difficult.
  * For some of these problems it will be quite helpful to write multiple functions.
  * SUPER HELPFUL CODING TIP
    * Use print statements inside your loops to see what is happening to your variables
    * Some of your loops may go intentionally go on for a while

Here are solutions for the first 50 problems:
