####Write the following python functions in a single .py file.

1. `closer_number`
  * Takes 3 numbers as arguments.
  * Returns a string that states which of the first two arguments is closer to the third.
    * By closeness we are referring to the distance between 2 numbers on a number line.
    * The distance between 16 and 10 is 6
    * The distance between 7 and 10 is 3
    * 7 is closer to 10 than 16
  * Examples
    ```
    closer_number(7, 16, 10) ==> '7 is closer to 10'
    closer_number(20, 3, 8) ==> '3 is closer to 8'
    closer_number (-5, 8, 0) ==> '-5 is closer to 0'
    ```
2. num_table
  * Takes 2 positive integer parameters (a, b)
  * Creates and returns a string containing the code for an HTML table with the following information for every integer (n) from a to b:
    * n, n^2, square root of n.
    * Each value should be it's own cell in the table.
    * Each new value of n should be a new row.
  * The table should look something like this:
    * ![table]({{"/assets/img/a15-0.png" | relative_url}})

  * Check that your function is creating valid HTML by copying the output and pasting it into a plain text file and viewing it in a web browser.
  * Remember, html attributes need to be surrounded by "s, so create your python strings accordingly.
