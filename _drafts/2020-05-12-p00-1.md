You are going to create a webpage based on your Data Project. This will be factored into your grade for the data project. Your webpage should be fully formatted HTML, using any styling you'd like. The content should be as follows:

1. Your name (partner's name, if applicable)
2. A succinct title.
3. Data Section
  * Describe your data, include:
    * General overview of what the data is.
    * Direct links to your data source(s).
    * Why you chose this data.
    * Anything you needed to do to make the data usable.
4. Graphs Section
  * Put images of the graphs your program created. You can either generate the images directly from matplotlib or run your program and take screen shots.
  * The graphs should speak for themselves, but you can add some description/context if you feel it is necessary.
5. Summary & Extensions
  * What did you learn about the data from the graphs?
  * Do you have new questions relating to the data? What would you do if you had more time to investigate?

Upload your website to moe, it should be accessible via the following url:
* __http://moe.stuy.edu/~USERNAME/data/index.html__
* Note this means all your files for this site (html, images, style sheets...) should be in a `data/` directory inside `public_html`
