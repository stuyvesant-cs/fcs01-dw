1. Write a function called `random_year()` that reads data from the NYC Population data file we've worked with before (available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mks22-dw/python/master/nyc_pop.csv)) picks a random line (but not the first line) and returns it.

2. Write another function `total_pop(line)`
   * Assume the parameter provided is a random line from the nyc population file.
   * It calculates the total population for the provided line.
   * It returns a string that should be a copy of the paramter with the total poulation at the end.
   * Example:
     * `total_pop('1890,1441216,838547,87050,88908,51693')` -> `'1890,1441216,838547,87050,88908,51693,2507414'`

3. Take such a processed line of school data, and then create the HTML and print a suitable web page from it:
  * The webpage should make a table out of the population data and look something like this (styling does not have to match): <http://moe.stuy.edu/~dw/randpop.py>
  * The webpage should have all the tags to make it properly formatted.
  * Do this in Thonny, you should be able to see the result printed out. Test it multiple times to make sure you are getting a random line each time.

4. Upload your python program and population data file to moe and test.
  * Not working? Why don't you check the [Python Website Checklist]({{"lessons/web_checklist.html" | relative_url}}){:target="_blank"}
