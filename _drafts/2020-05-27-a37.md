Write a regular HTML file with a form designed to send data to _query.py_ from yesterday's assignment. The form should have the following elements:
* A text box for the user to enter their name.
* A menu for the user to select the appropriate census year.
* A submit button.
* Modify your query.py program so that it checks if the request contains the text box value and if it does, include that information in the response.
* The page should work (but need not _look_) like this: <http://moe.stuy.edu/~dw/query.html>{:target="_blank"}

Submit the html to the homework server and upload it to moe.
