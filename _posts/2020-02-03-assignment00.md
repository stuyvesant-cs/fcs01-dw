1. Log into the Homework Server: <http://bert.stuy.edu/dyrland/spring2020/pages.py>
    * Your current password is your OSIS, __change your password__.
2. Look up the following command line commands, test them out, then in a __Plain Text File__ explain what they do, include an example of how to use them.
   * Here's an example of what you should put in this file:
   ```
man
Look up information about a command from the manual. Use arrow keys to move up or down. Type q at any time to exit.
usage: $ man COMMAND
example: $ man ls
    ```
   * The commands:
      * ls (ls -a, ls -l)
      * pwd
      * cat
      * touch
      * cp
      * mv
      * mkdir
      * ssh
      * nano

3. On school computers, create the following directory structure starting in your home directory.

    ```
    $ tree marvel/
    marvel/
    ├── heroes
    │   ├── avengers
    │   │   ├── black_widow.txt
    │   │   └── hulk.txt
    │   └── xmen
    │       ├── storm.txt
    │       └── wolverine.txt
    └── villains
        ├── hydra
        │   └── red_skull.txt
        └── thanos.txt

    5 directories, 6 files
    ```
    * In a plain text file, write down the exact sequence of commands you used to do this, putting each command on its own line.
    * Want access to your files from home? Use ssh
      * On a linux or mac computer, open a terminal session and type $ ssh USERNAME@COMPUTER
      * For example: `$ ssh dw@homer.stuycs.org`
      * On windows computers, download an ssh client, I highly recommend [putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
      * You can access the teacher station of room 307 as homer.stuycs.org
      * You can access any computer in room 307 as cslab1-<number>.stuy (e.g. cslab1-4.stuy.edu)
