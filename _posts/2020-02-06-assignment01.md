1. Find 2 online resources each for HTML and CSS.
2. Write a simple html file, properly formatted (which means include the non-visible html tags DOCTYPE html  head and body), that uses the following tags (you can include others if you'd like):
   * a
   * br
   * img
   * ul
   * li
   * To test your anchor tags, include the links you found in step 1.
3. What is a properly-formatted html page you ask? Why don't you look here: <https://github.com/mks22-dw/html/blob/master/template.html>
4. In addition to submitting your file over the hw server, you must also place it in your __public_html__ directory using the name __basic_html.html__
