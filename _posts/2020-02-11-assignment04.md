* Look up how to create tables in HTML
  * You should focus on the following tags: `table tr th td`.
  * Other table-related tags are not needed.
* Below is a picture of a webpage
* You mission, is to recreate that webpage.
* You can replace the text and images with your own choices, but the format must be identical (location of images, newlines, headings, table layout...)
* Try to use links for images instead of image files, the pages will probably load faster and it will take less time to submit
* Upload this to public_html as html_1.html
* Submit this to the hw server as html_1

![webpage]({{ "/assets/img/a03-0.png" | relative_url }})


If that was too easy, try this one:

![challenge]({{ "/assets/img/a03-1.png" | relative_url }})
