You all have now had an opportunity to get your HTML/CSS bearings, now it's your time to shine!

Your mission is to create a webpage that demonstrates your abilities. It should be about something (or some things) that you enjoy. You can make any kind of page you want, with any HTML and CSS (javascript even) that you'd like. Explore what is possible and include at least 2 new HTML tags and 2 new CSS types.

Once you've created your page, you may choose to enter it in the webpage contest!
  * The class will vote on the best pages.
  * Winners will receive bragging rights!
  * If you wish to enter your page in the contest, leave a Student-to-teacher comment in the homework server when you upload your page.
  * You have until Monday morning, 2/26 to complete your page!

Name your page in public_html as home.html
