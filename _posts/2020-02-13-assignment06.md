As a review, do the following:
  * Create a web page that contains a table.
  * The table should list all the terminal commands that have come up in class, along with an example and a description.
  * Also include a heading, and whatever else you'd like (but don't make the page too crowded)
  * put this in your public_html as test1_review.html
