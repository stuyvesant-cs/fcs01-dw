* Using a `for` loop, write a function that will return the number of times a specific element appears in a collection.
  * You had to do this in the __list_lab__, but this time you must use a `for` loop.
  * Examples:
    * `count(4, [1, 2, 3, 4]) ==> 1`
    * `count('a', 'abracadabra') ==> 5`

* Using `for`, write a function that will take a list of numbers and return a new list that contains the values from the parameter list doubled.
  * Example: `doublify([6, 3, -8, 3.5]) ==> [12, 6, -16, 7]`

* Write a function that takes a list of numbers and adds 10 to each element. The fucntion shoudl not return anything.
  * Example:
    ```
    g = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    add_ten(g)
    print(g)
    # Should print [11, 12, 13, 14]
    ```
  * Think before you code: should you use `for` in this function?
