* Recently, we've done some python work that involves manipulating data sets in our programs. As described in the csv lab, there is a lot of data available in easy-to-parse formats.
* As a class, I would like us to collect as many different sources of data we can to be used in the future.
* This way, you won't be stuck just using the data I provide.
* When looking for data, make sure of the following:
  * The data is not beind a paywall.
  * The data can be saved in __plain text__.
  * The data is parsable in some reasonable way. Examples:
    * csv: comma separated values, where rows are separated by newlines and data is separated by ,
    * tsv: tab separated values, where rows are separated by newlines and data is separated by TAB (`\t`)
    * text: in the case of books, articles, tweets, etc, we can parse resaonably well since words are _usually_ separated by spaces. As long as the text is available in plain text format, we can use it. For example, if you found the complete works of shakesspeare in plain text, we could do something with that.
* When you've found data, fill out the following form:
  * <https://forms.gle/cgvNwfQpq6kkh39n6>
* You will be able to see the responses here (I've put an example entry in to help get things started):
