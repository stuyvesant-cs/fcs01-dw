__First off, get matplotlib into Thonny__
* Video instructions for Windows/Linux: <https://youtu.be/Oo-B98WWre8>
* On Windows or Linux (possibly on Mac, but may not work)
    1. Go to the __Tools__ menu, select __Manage Packages...__
    2. Type __matplotlib__ into the text box, click __Search__
    3. Click the __Install__ button, wait for it to finish.
    * When done, you should see both __matplotlib__ and __numpy__ listed in the text box on the left hand side. If you do not see __numpy__, install it the same way you installed matplotlib.
    * To test, in the Thonny shell, type `import matplotlib`, if you don't get any erros, then you've done it!
  * On MacOS
    * Download the version of Thonny found here: <https://github.com/thonny/thonny/releases/download/v3.2.7/thonny-3.2.7-ent.pkg>
    * This comes pre-packaged with a bunch of extra libraries, including matplotlib.

__Now that's done, let's plot!__
* Create three lists with 10 numbers each:
  * One should have numbers increasing linearly (like `[0, 1, 2...]` or `[0, 10, 20...]`)
  * One should have numbers increasing qradratically (like `[0, 1, 4, 9...]` or `[0, 100, 400, 900...]`)
  * One should have numbers increasing exponentially (like `[0, 2, 4, 8...]` )
  * Create a line graph that displays all three lists.
    * It should look something like this:
    * ![lines]({{"/assets/img/a24-0.png" | relative_url}})
* Create three lists with 100 numbers each:
  * Two should have random integers in the range [1, 50)
  * The thrid should contain the values of the first list divided by the values of the second list.
     * `[ list0[0]/list1[0], list0[1]/list1[1], ...]`
  * Create a scatter plot from the 2 random lists, with the scale factors set by the third list.
    * It should look something like this:
    * ![dots]({{"/assets/img/a24-1.png" | relative_url}})
