* The following lists contain data from the csv lab assignment:
    ```
    pops_2010 = [1585873,2504700,2230722,1385108,468730]
    labels = ['Manhattan', 'Brooklyn', 'Queens', 'Bronx', 'Staten Island']
    ```
  * Create a bar graph displaying the population of each borough, the x axis should be labeled by borough.

* Use `random.randrange` to create a list of 100,000 random numbers in the range [0, 100).
  * Create a histogram of this list with 10 bars.
  * Create a histogram of this list with 50 bars.

* Use `random.normalvariate` to create a list of 100,000 numbers using a [normal distribution](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-normal-distribution.html). You may remember this from the list_lab assignment. The random values should have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 1 (these are the 2 arguments to `random.normalvariate`).
  * Create a histogram of this list with 25 bars.
  * Create a histogram of this list with 100 bars.
