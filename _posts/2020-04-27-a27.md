Write the following turtle-based functions.

* `regular_polygon(t, n, size)`
  * Instructs turtle `t` to draw a regular polygon of `n` sides each of length `size`

* `square_spiral(t, size)`
  * Instructs turtle `t` to draw a _square spiral_ starting with length `size`.
  * A square spiral looks like this:
    * ![suqare spiral]({{"/assets/img/a27-0.png" | relative_url}})
  * It's similar to drawing a square, except each side is shorter than the previous.

* `spiral(t, size, angle)`
  * Instructs turtle `t` to draw a _spiral_ starting with length `size`, rotating `angle` degrees each time.
  * This is very similar to the square spiral.
