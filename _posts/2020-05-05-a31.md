Write a binary search function. use the following header:
  * `bin_search(g, key, low, high)`
    * This should recurseively search list `g` for `key` starting at index `low` and ending at index `high`.
    * Look at the lesson for today for a detailed description of the algorithm.
  * In order to test bin_search you will need a sorted list. There is a python function to help:
    * `sorted(g)` will return a new list that contains the contents of list `g` in ascending order.
  * You also may want to make a large list of random values, we've done this before, but here's a quick function to do so:
    ```
    def rand_list(n, limit):
    g = []
    while (n > 0):
        g.append(random.randrange(limit))
        n-= 1
    return g
    ```
