Make a web page for something about which you are knowledgeable (could be anything, an academic subject, sport, music, theater, movie, comic ...). The page should not be an exhaustive report on the subject, but provide some information in a coherent framework. Your page should include the following parts:

* A main title/heading
  - [heading element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements): `<h1>`

* A table of contents
  - [list element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul): `<ul>` and `<li>`
  - You should have at least 3 sections listed.

* Sections of text that correspond to each emement in the table of contents.
  - Each section should start with a `<h2>` tag.
  - The text for each section should be in a `<p>` tag.
  - Each section should contain at least one [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a): `<a>`
  - Feel free to add [pictures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img): `<img>`

Notes:
  * You can see an example page with required html elements on the [solutions gh repository](https://github.com/mks22-dw/html)
  * You may be tempted to do things to modify the look of your page. __Do not__. Focus on the structure of the page, for that is what HTML is designed to do. Next week we will work on making pages look fancy, at which point you can [go nuts](http://www.csszengarden.com)
  * The downside to using GitHub pages is that there is a delay between updating your HTML and being able to see that change published. If you want, you can develop your HTML _locally__ (that is, on your home computer). To do this:
    - First make sure you have a good text editor.
      - For macOS, I sugest [TextMate](https://macromates.com/) - do not use Text Edit
      - For windows, I suggest [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
    - Create your .html file.
    - While editing your .html file in your text editor, open the file in a web browser (use the __Open__ option from the __File__ menu). Your page should load.
    - When you make changes to the file in your text editor, reload the page in your browser.
    - When done, make sure to upload your file to your web repository on github.
