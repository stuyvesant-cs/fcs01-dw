Make a web page for something about which you are knowledgeable (could be anything, an academic subject, sport, music, theater, movive, comic ...). The page should not be an exhaustive report on the subject, but provide some information in a coherent framework. Your page should include the following parts:

* A main title/heading

  - [heading element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements): `<h1>`
* A table of contents
  - [list element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul): `<ul>` and `<li>`
  - You should have at least 3 sections listed.
* Sections of text that correspond to each emement in the table of contents.
  - Each section should start with a `<h2>` tag.
  - The text for each section should be in a `<p>` tag.
  - Each section should contain at least one [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a): `<a>`
  - Feel free to add [pictures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img): `<img>`
