Add styling to your __subject.html__ page by using an external css style sheet. You should only need to add the apporpriate `link` tag to your html (you are welcome to fix any html errors you may have discovered as well). You will __submit the css file__ to the hw server.

  * Your css should modify _at least_ three tags with different rules.
  * Your css should include _at least_ one instance of the `font` property.
    - For more information check [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font).
    - Note that you can separate many of the font propery values to _constituent properties_ (i.e. `font-style`, `font-size`...)
  * Your css should include _at least_ two properties in addition to `font`.
  * Some initial properties worth investigating:
    - [background-color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color)
    - [color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color)
    - [font](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font)
    - [border](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border)
  * [css color names](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#color_keywords)
  * [css color picker](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/)
  * [General css guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS)
  * [css glossary](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) (this is a list of every valid word in css, lots more than what we discussed).

Notes:
  * The downside to using GitHub pages is that there is a delay between updating your HTML and being able to see that change published. If you want, you can develop your HTML _locally__ (that is, on your home computer). To do this:
    - First make sure you have a good text editor.
      - For macOS, I sugest [TextMate](https://macromates.com/) - do not use Text Edit
      - For windows, I suggest [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
    - Create your .html file.
    - Create your .css file.
    - While editing your .html file in your text editor, open the file in a web browser (use the __Open__ option from the __File__ menu). Your page should load.
    - When you make changes to the file in your text editor, reload the page in your browser.
    - When done, make sure to upload your file to your web repository on github.
