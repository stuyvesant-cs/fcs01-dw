You're going to turn your subject.html page into a larger web site! At a minimum, your site should have the following files:
  * A main landing page: __site.html__
    - This page should explain what your site is about.
  * A page for each section from your original subject.html page
    - This means you should have at least 3 such pages.
    - Each page should contain at least 1 link and 1 image.
  * A single css file used by all your pages.
  * The list at the beginning of yout subject.html page should turn into a horizontal or vertical menu where each list item is a link to the respective page.
    - The navigational menu should also contain a link to the main landing page.

Your entire site should be visible on the web via github pages. You should submit 2 files to the homework server in their respective slots:
  * Your site.html
  * You css file.

You will want to go back over the HTML and CSS links from the previous 2 assignments. You may also find the following resources helpful:
