# Write the following functions in python.

* `find_letter`
  - Determine if a single character string appears in another stirng.
  - DO NOT use the built-in string method find!
  - You must return the index of the leftmost occurrence of the letter in the original string, or a -1 if it isn't found.
  - Examples
    ```
    find_letter('fish', 'f') ==> 0
    find_letter('fish', 'F') ==> -1
    find_letter('fish', 'h') ==> 3
    ```

* `count_letter`
  - Return how many times a single character string is in another string.
  - Do NOT use the built in string method count.
  - Examples:
    ```
    count_letter('fishiii', 'i') ==> 4
    count_letter('fishiii', 'f') ==> 1
    count_letter('fishiii', 'I') ==> 0
    ```

* `is_vowel`
  - Return `True` when the string is a single character vowel (a e i o or u). `False` otherwise.
  - Upper/lower case should not matter.
  - Examples
    ```
    is_vowel('a') ==> True
    is_vowel('E') ==> True
    is_vowel('I') ==> True
    is_vowel('eieio') ==> False
    ```

* count_vowels
  - Return the number of vowels in the given string, based on the same rules as `is_vowel`
  - Examples
    ```
    count_vowels('fash') ==> 1
    count_vowels('fishi') ==> 2
    count_vowels('faAsh') ==> 2
    ```

is_cap
prev  |  next  |  chanc
Return true when the string is a single character, and that character is a e i o or u, upper/lower case should not matter. Return false otherwise.
