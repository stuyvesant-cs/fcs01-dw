# Write the following functions in python.

* `closer_number`
  * Takes 3 numbers as arguments.
  * Returns a string that states which of the first two arguments is closer to the third.
    * By closeness we are referring to the distance between 2 numbers on a number line.
    * The distance between 16 and 10 is 6
    * The distance between 7 and 10 is 3
    * 7 is closer to 10 than 16
  * Examples
    ```
    closer_number(7, 16, 10) ==> '7 is closer to 10'
    closer_number(20, 3, 8) ==> '3 is closer to 8'
    closer_number (-5, 8, 0) ==> '-5 is closer to 0'
    ```
* `num_table`
  * Takes 2 positive integer parameters `(a, b)`
  * Creates and returns a string containing the code for an HTML table with the following information for every integer (`n`) from `a` to `b`:
    * `n`, `n^2`, square root of `n`.
    * Each value should be it's own cell in the table.
    * Each new value of n should be a new row.
  * Wait MR DW! We never learned about HTML tables!
    - Correct! But you are smart, and can learn from documentation.
    - Find all you need to know about the HTML `<table>` element [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table)
  * The table should look something like this (borders were added as styling for clarity, you need not worry about any styling):
    * ![table]({{"/assets/img/a15-0.png" | relative_url}})
  * One way to check that your function is creating valid HTML by copying the output and pasting it into a plain text file and viewing it in a web browser.
  * Here's an example of an HTML table:
    ```
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>First Name</th>
            <th>Last Name</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Peter</td>
            <td>Broks</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Topher</td>
            <td>Mykolyk</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    ```
