# Rot13 Lab
Complete the rot13 lab you began to work on during class. Here were the instructions, with added clarification:
* Copy the rot13_lab.py file found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mks22-dw/python/main/rot13_lab.py) and paste it into Thonny.
* The file has 6 problems, each with detailed comments and function skeletons where needed.
* Start with question 0 and work your way forward, as each problem relies on the previous solution.
* I will be marking this based on how well it works.
* If you cannot solve one of the problems, you should provide a description of what you believe to be the solution and/or what you've tried already. You can write this in a string and have the program print it out when run.
