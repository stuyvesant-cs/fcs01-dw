# Write the following functions in python.
- makeListOneToN
  - Make a list of integers of all integers from 1 to n inclusive. They should be in increasing order. Do not use the range function.
    - makeListOneToN(0) → []
    - makeListOneToN(1) → [1]
    - makeListOneToN(3) → [1, 2, 3]

- makeEvenListToN
  - Make a list of the even numbers from 0 to n, in increasing order. Do not use the range function.
  - makeEvenListToN(0) → [0]
  - makeEvenListToN(1) → [0]
  - makeEvenListToN(3) → [0, 2]

- makeSentence
  - Take all of the strings in the list, and combine them into one string, separated by spaces. Assume the strings are non-empty and do not start or end with space. Do not use the join() method.
  - makeSentence([]) → ''
  - makeSentence(['bob']) → 'bob'
  - makeSentence(['hot', 'dog']) → 'hot dog'

- makeFibList
  - Make a list of the Fibonacci numbers up to the nth term. The 0'th element is 0, the 1st is 1.
  - makeFibList(0) → [0]
  - makeFibList(1) → [0, 1]
  - makeFibList(2) → [0, 1, 1]
