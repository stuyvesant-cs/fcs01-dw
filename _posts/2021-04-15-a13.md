# Write the following functions in python.
* 'draw_square'
  - Takes a turtle and a number as parameters.
  - Have the turtle draw a square with side length equal to the number parameter.
    - Exaple usage:
      ```
      leonardo = turtle.Turtle()
      draw_square(leonardo, 200)
      ```

* `draw_spiral0`
  - Write a funtion that draws a stright spiral given a turtle and the length of the initial side.
  - A stright spiral is a sprial like shape made of sides that are straight lines at 90 degree angles to each other. Each side is shorter than the previous side.
  - A square piral mat look like this: ![square spiral]({{"/assets/img/a27-0.png" | relative_url}})

* `draw_spiral1`
  - Write a more generic `spiral` function, that will make a turtle draw a sprial shape given an initial side length and the angle it should turn each time.
