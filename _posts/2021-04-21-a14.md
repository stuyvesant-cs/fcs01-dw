A Fractal tree is a geometric design meant to imitate the image of a tree. We can write a recursive function that creates a tree based on the `depth` we want. Here are the first few depths:
  * depth = 0: ![d0]({{"/assets/img/a14-00.png" | relative_url}})
  * depth = 1: ![d1]({{"/assets/img/a14-01.png" | relative_url}})
  * depth = 2: ![d2]({{"/assets/img/a14-02.png" | relative_url}})

# Write a function, `tree(t, depth, length, angle)`
  * It makes turtles `t` draw a fractal tree with the given `depth`, `length` and `angle`.
  * You should define this function recursively.
  * If you have the regular fractal tree working, there are a number of potential changes to be made for more interesting drawings. Some examples:
    - Shortening the size of the trees with each recursive call. (by a set amount or a percentage)
    - Changing the width of the pen such that it gets thinner with each recursive call (see [turtle.width](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.width)).
    - Changing the color to more closely match tree/leaf colors (see [turtle.pencolor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.pencolor))
    - Changing the length/angle values by a random amount to better model the variablity of nature.
