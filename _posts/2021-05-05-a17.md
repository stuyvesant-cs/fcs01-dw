# Write the following python functions
* `lists2dict`
  * Write a function that takes 2 lists of equal size, and returns a dictionary where the keys are the elements of the first list and the values are the elements of the second list.
  * Example:
    * `lists2dict(['v', 'viii', 'iv'], ['empire strikes back', 'force awakens', 'new hope'])` ==> `{'v': 'empire strikes back', 'viii': 'force awakens', 'iv': 'new hope'}`

* `combine_dict`
  * Write a function that takes 2 dictionaries, combines them into a new dictionary and returns it.
  * The values in the new dictionary should be _lists_ that contain the values from the parameter dictionaries.
  * Example:
    * `combine_dict( {'a' : 'apple', 'z' : 'zed', 'q' : 'quixotic'}, {'b' : 'boba', 'a' : 'akbar', 'z' : 'zoo', 'w' : 'wombat' })` ==> `{'a': ['apple', 'akbar'], 'z': ['zed', 'zoo'], 'q': ['quixotic'], 'b': ['boba'], 'w': ['wombat']}`

* `word_counts`
  * This function will take a string containing words.
  * It will return a dictionary where each key is a word from the parameter, and the values will be the number of times that word appears in the string. (this is a simpler function from yesterday's `song_common_words`)
  * Example:
    ```
    tobe = 'to be or not to be that is the question'
    word_counts(tobe) ==> {'to': 2, 'be': 2, 'or': 1, 'not': 1, 'that': 1, 'is': 1, 'the': 1, 'question': 1}
    ```

* `remove_commons`
  * This function takes a dictionary of word counts (like what is returned by `word_counts`) and a list of words.
  * It will remove any entry in the dictionary where the key is found in the list of words provided.
  * Example:
    ```
    tobe_counts = word_counts(tobe)
    remove_commons(tobe_counts, common)
    print(tobe_counts) ==> {'or': 1, 'not': 1, 'is': 1, 'question': 1}
    ```
* NOT FUNCTIONS
  * Use the last two functions to answer the following questions:
    - For each of these questions, write python code to provide the answer, you can test them out on the short `tobe` string above, or use something longer. Below I will re-post the string used in the previous assingment.
    - How many individual words in a string are not in the 10 most common english words?
    - How many words in a string appear exactly once?
    - What percentage of words in a string are in the 10 most common english words?

    thumb = """when you're lost in the rain in juarez and it's eastertime too and your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through don't put on any airs when you're down on rue morgue avenue they got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outa you.  now if you see saint annie please tell her thanks a lot i cannot move my fingers are all in a knot i don't have the strength to get up and take another shot and my best friend, my doctor won't even say what it is i've got.  sweet melinda the peasants call her the goddess of gloom she speaks good english and she invites you up into her room and you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon and she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.  up on housing project hill it's either fortune or fame you must pick up one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim if you're lookin' to get silly you better go back to from where you came because the cops don't need you and man they expect the same. now all the authorities they just stand around and boast how they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post and picking up angel who just arrived here from the coast who looked so fine at first but left looking just like a ghost.  i started out on burgundy but soon hit the harder stuff everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough but the joke was on me there was nobody even there to bluff i'm going back to new york city i do believe i've had enough."""
