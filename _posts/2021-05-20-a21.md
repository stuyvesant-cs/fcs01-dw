# Create a python file that generates the following graphs
* Sleep Line Graph
  - Use the sleep data that should be shared in your breakout team's chat on RocketChat.
  - Use matplotlib to generate a line graph where each list is plotted. Running your python file should result in a graph being displayed.
  - Add axis labels, legend, and title to your graph.
* Manhattan Rents
  - I found a dataset of ~3500 Manhattan rent values. You can get it [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mks22-dw/python/main/manhattan_rent.csv).
    - The data has rent price, apartment size, number of bedrooms.
  - In the same python program as your line graph above:
    - Open and read in the rent file.
    - Create 3 lists, rents, size, bedrooms.
    - Populate those lists with values from the rent file, make sure the values are numbers.
      - for example, the first few entreis should look like this:
        - rent: `[2550, 11500, 4500]`
        - size: `[480, 2000, 916]`
        - rooms: `[0.0, 2.0, 1.0]`
    - Generate a scatterplot with the following features:
      - x-axis: rent price
      - y-axis: size
      -
