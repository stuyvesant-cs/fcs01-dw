# Optional Lab assignment
* Copy the `rank_lab.py` file found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mks22-dw/python/main/rank_choice_lab.py) and paste it into Thonny.
* The file has 8 problems, each with detailed comments and function skeletons where needed.
* Remember this lab is **optional**.
  - The assessment part of your grade will be made of
    - Website project
    - Python test project
    - Final project
    - Labs: rot13, list, merge, csv
      - I will drop the lowest lab grade (only lab grade)
    - If you do this lab, it will be added to your lab grade total, and the lowest grade will be dropped after that.
    - If you don't do this lab, your lab grade will be computed as described above.
