- I've also included links to documentation for each tag you need to use below.


#### Write a real Web Page
Write a simple html file, properly formatted (which means include the non-visible html tags like `DOCTYPE` `html`  `head` and `body`), that uses the following elements (you can include others if you'd like):
 * [heading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements): `<h1>`
 * [anchor (link)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a): `<a>`
 * [list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul): `<ul>` and `<li>`
 * [image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img): `<img>`

#### Submission Notes
Make sure your page is in your `public_html` directory on your school computer __and__ added to your github repository as well.
- If you work on this from home, after you've uploaded your changes to GitHub, you'll have to pull them onto your local home directory at school.
