Remember, all website work should be in your web repository:
- Period 9 GH Classroom link: <https://classroom.github.com/a/uM_xihHm>
- Period 10 GH Classroom link: <https://classroom.github.com/a/YUn44KQM>

#### Helpful resources:
- [Template HTML page](https://github.com/mks22-dw/dwsource/blob/main/html/template.html)

Make a web page for something about which you are knowledgeable (could be anything, an academic subject, sport, music, theater, movie, comic ...). The page should not be an exhaustive report on the subject, but provide some information in a coherent framework. Your page should include the following parts:

* A main title/heading
  - [heading element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements): `<h1>`
* A table of contents made of an unordered list.
  - [list element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul): `<ul>` and `<li>`
  - You should have at least 3 sections listed.
* Sections of text that correspond to each element in the table of contents.
  - Each section should start with a `<h2>` tag.
  - The text for each section should be in a `<p>` tag.
  - Each section should contain at least one [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a): `<a>`
  - Feel free to add [pictures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img): `<img>`

Notes:
- You may be tempted to do things to modify the look of your page. __Do not__. Focus on the structure of the page, for that is what HTML is designed to do. We _will_ work on making pages look fancy using CSS, at which point you can [go nuts](http://www.csszengarden.com)
- If you want to work on this at home with the same tool presented in class, you can [download and install pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/download.html#regular-releases).
- You will have to configure and set SSH keys on your home computer in order to use the git integration tools in pulsar. You can follow instructions form the class notes about this, they will be similar for windows, but you'll have to use the command prompt, and you should pay attention to where it stores your keys.
