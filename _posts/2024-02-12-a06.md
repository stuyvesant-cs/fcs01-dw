Remember, all website work should be in your web repository:
- Period 9 GH Classroom link: <https://classroom.github.com/a/uM_xihHm>
- Period 10 GH Classroom link: <https://classroom.github.com/a/YUn44KQM>

#### Helpful resources:
- [Template HTML page](https://github.com/mks22-dw/dwsource/blob/main/html/template.html)
- [Table of common elements from notes](https://www.stuycs.org/dwlessons/fcs/selector_view.html?slides=05_html.md#22)

#### CSS Time
Create a css file called `w06_style.css` in your web repository. This will be a style file used on your webpage for `w03.html`.
- In this file you must set at least one css property for each element in the html file except for `head` and anything in `head`.
- This file should have at least one example for each of the properties [in this table](https://www.stuycs.org/dwlessons/fcs/selector_view.html?slides=06_css.md#19).
- Add your css file to the html file `w03.html`.
