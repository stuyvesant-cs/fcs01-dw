Remember, all website work should be in your web repository:
- Period 9 GH Classroom link: <https://classroom.github.com/a/uM_xihHm>
- Period 10 GH Classroom link: <https://classroom.github.com/a/YUn44KQM>

#### Helpful resources:
- [Template HTML page](https://github.com/mks22-dw/dwsource/blob/main/html/template.html)
- [Table of common elements from notes](https://www.stuycs.org/dwlessons/fcs/selector_view.html?slides=05_html.md#22)

#### CSS Time
Create a css file called `w06_style.css` in your web repository. This will be a style file used on your webpage for `w03.html`.
- In this file you must set at least one css property for each element in the html file except for `head` and anything in `head`.
- This file should have at least one example for each of the properties [in this table](https://www.stuycs.org/dwlessons/fcs/selector_view.html?slides=06_css.md#19).
- Add your css file to the html file `w03.html`.

#### Notes About Working From Home
- Your home computer is probably not set up as a webserver, this is fine, but it means you'll have to work a little differently than at school. First off, you will need a text editor and a web browser. I suggest [pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/download.html#regular-releases) as your text editor. You must use a plain text editor, so something like word or google docs is __NOT__ acceptable.
- Open your HTML and CSS files in your text editor, this is where you will edit them.
- Also open your HTML (not the CSS, it will be included via the HTML file) in your web browser. Open it via the _Open File_ option in the File menu of your browser. The address bar will start with: `file:///` followed by the path to your HTML file.
- As you edit your CSS, reload the HTML file in the browser. You may need to do a force reload (on firefox, that's ctrl-shift-r)

#### Pulling Work From Home Onto the Stuy Web Servers
- First, make sure your updated work is on GitHub, however you can make that happen (either via the command line, pulsar, web interface ...)
- Once that's done, then you known the work is uploaded to your repository, so now you need to `pull` it onto the stuy computers.
- Open the command line environment on your computer.
  - On a MacOS or Linux computer, open the __Terminal__ program.
  - On a Windows computer, open the __Command Prompt__ program.
- Connect to a stuycs server using ssh.
  - Use the following command: `$ ssh USER@homer.stuy.edu` replace `USER` with your cs lab username.
  - Enter your password when prompted (you may also need to agree that you trust the server).
  - If this worked, then you will have a command line identical to one you would open up using the terminal at school. You are now connected to the school computer. Any commands you run will be based on your school account, not your home computer.
- `cd` into your `public_html` directory and use `$ git pull` to download any changes from GitHub.
- If you cannot connect to homer, you can try these servers instead:
  - `$ ssh USER@bart.stuy.edu`
  - `$ ssh USER@lisa.stuy.edu`
  - `$ ssh USER@marge.stuy.edu`
