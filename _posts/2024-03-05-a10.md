#### Submission Name: {{ page.sub_name }}

#### 9th period: See notes below

#### Write the following functions in python using `while`.
- `fizz_buzz(limit)`
  - Loops through the integers in the range \[1, limit\]
  - If a number is a multiple of 3, print the number and `fizz`.
  - If a number is a multiple of 5, print the number and `buzz`
  - If a number is a multiple of 3 and 5, print the number and `fizzbuzz!` (this should not also print `fizz` and `buzz`)
  - Sample output:
  ```
  fizz_buzz(25)
  3 fizz
  5 buzz
  6 fizz
  9 fizz
  10 buzz
  12 fizz
  15 fizzbuzz!
  18 fizz
  20 buzz
  21 fizz
  ```

- `fizz_what(limit, fizz_num, buzz_num)`
  - Works like `fizz_buzz`, but instead of 3 and 5, use `fizz_num` and `buzz_num`
  - Sample output:
  ```
  fizz_what(50, 6, 9)
  6 fizz
  9 buzz
  12 fizz
  18 fizzbuzz!
  24 fizz
  27 buzz
  30 fizz
  36 fizzbuzz!
  42 fizz
  45 buzz
  48 fizz
  ```

- `sub_digs(n)`
  - Returns the sum of the digits in `n`.
  - Example: `sum_digs(87243)` ==> `24`

#### Special Notes on `while`
Loops are one of the main ways we write code that repeats itself in python (in racket, it was recursion, in NetLogo it was a forever button). There are a couple of loop structures in python, we will start with `while`.

#### While Loop
`while`
  ```
  while boolean_expression:
      code
  ```
- All `code` inside the `while` loop statement is repeatedly run as long as `boolean_expression` is `True`

- Example:
```
n = 10
s = 0
while ( n > 0):
    s = s + n
    print(n, s)
    n = n - 1
print(s)
```
Would print:
```
10 10
9 19
8 27
7 34
6 40
5 45
4 49
3 52
2 54
1 55
55
```
