#### Write the following python functions
* `splitName`
  * Takes a string representing a name as a parameter. Assume the string has a first and last name, separated by spaces, like `"Eddie Vedder"`
  * Should __return__ a string with each part of the name on its own line
  * Example:
    ```
    >>> print(splitName("John Shaft"))
    John
    Shaft
    ```
* `bondify`
  * Names sound cooler the way James Bond says them ("Bond... James Bond"), so we'll write a python program to do that!
  * Takes a single parameter representing a name, the same format as splitName.
  * Should return a new string with the input name written Bond style.
  * Example: `bondify("Mr DW") ==> "DW... Mr DW"`

* `findLast`
  * Takes 2 parameters, one representing a string and the second representing a character.
  * Returns the index of the last occurrence of the character in the string, or -1 if the character is not in the string.
  * Examples
    ```
    findLast( 'hello', 'l') ==> 3
    findLast('hello', 'h') ==> 0
    findLast('hello', 'z') ==> -1
    ```

* replace
  * This function will take a string and replace part of it with something new
  * Takes 3 string parameters, The first represents the original string, the second represents the part you want to take out (key), and the last represents the replacement string.
  * Returns a new string that is a copy of the original except that the replacement string is located where the key use to be.
  * If the key is not in the original string, you should return the original, unmodified.
  * Example: `replace("I hate cs!", "hate", "love") ==> "I love cs!"`
