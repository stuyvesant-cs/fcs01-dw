### Test Description
The exam on Friday will cover the following major topics:
- Python basics (variables, operators, functions)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`)
- While loops
- String basics (`len`, `find`, indexing, `ord`, `chr`)
- The exam will have multiple choice questions and functions to write. It may have other short-answer type questions as well.

###
You can find all the submitted test questions here: <https://github.com/mks22-dw/dwsource/tree/main/tests/test00>

Pick 4 of the programming questions to complete. At the beginning of each function you write, include the question number above as a comment. Be sure to include test cases with your program.

You are encouraged to work on more problems to prepare for the exam. You should also take a look at the multiple choice questions. I have not vetted all the questions, so there may be mistakes.
