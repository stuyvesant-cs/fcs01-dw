Use `map`, `filter`, `reduce` and `lambda` to answer the questions below. For some, you may need more than one line of code:

Here is a list of the names of all the Major League Baseball teams, copy this into a python program:
```
['Los Angeles Angels', 'Oakland Athletics', 'Los Angeles Dodgers', 'San Diego Padres', 'San Francisco Giants', 'Tampa Bay Rays', 'Miami Marlins', 'Chicago Cubs', 'Chicago White Sox', 'Kansas City Royals', 'St. Louis Cardinals', 'New York Mets', 'New York Yankees', 'Cincinnati Reds', 'Cleveland Guardians', 'Philadelphia Phillies', 'Pittsburgh Pirates', 'Houston Astros', 'Texas Rangers', 'Arizona Diamondbacks', 'Colorado Rockies', 'Washington Nationals', 'Atlanta Braves', 'Baltimore Orioles', 'Boston Red Sox', 'Detroit Tigers', 'Minnesota Twins', 'Seattle Mariners', 'Milwaukee Brewers']
```
1. Create a list that contains the length of each of the team names.
2. Create a list that contains only team names that are less than 15 characters long.
3. Create a list that contains the number of words in each team name.
   - So `New York Yankees` would be 3, while `Detroit Tigers` would be 2
   - `s.count(' ')` will return the number of times a space appears in string `s`. This will be helpful
4. Find the number of teams with 2 word names.
5. Find the number of teams with 3 word names.
6. Create a string made by combining the second word of all the 2 word teams.
