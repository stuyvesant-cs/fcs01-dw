On Monday, there will be a [solar eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/the-eclipse-nasa/). While New York City will not see a total eclipse, we will be in line for 90% coverage (check out nasa's [nifty eclipse explorer map](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/where-when/)). This is a rare event, the next time NYC will be in the path of a solar eclipse will be 2079.

The eclipse will be visible form approximately 2:15 - 4:30, with the peak being at 3:25pm. I want us all to have the opportunity to see this thing, so I've arranged a "Trip" with Ms. Prabhu to Rockefeller Park (the one next to Stuy) during our CS classes. Here are the details:
- The trip will only last during your CS class period, you cannot use this to get out of your 9th or 10th period non-cs class.
- Each period will meet on the first floor in the main lobby near the entrance.
- We will walk out and return as a class.
- YOU CANNOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SUN, even during an eclipse. Ms. Prabhu and I will be providing eclipse glasses. You must return them to me at the end of class. (You can get your own free glasses from various places, included all Public Libraries, you don't even need a library card).
- I need to collect permission slips. Hand them in on Friday. I have given these out in class but you can also print them from here:
  - [Period 9]({{"/assets/img/eclipse-permission-09.pdf" | relative_url}})
  - [Period 10]({{"/assets/img/eclipse-permission-10.pdf" | relative_url}})
