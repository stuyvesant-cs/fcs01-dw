#### Reminder
Check yesterday's post for information about Monday's special Eclipse class.

### Write the following functions in python.
`draw_square(t, size)`
- Takes a turtle and a number as parameters.
- Have the turtle draw a square with side length equal to the number parameter.
  - Exaple usage:
    ```
    leonardo = turtle.Turtle()
    draw_square(leonardo, 200)
    ```

`draw_spiral0(t, size)`
- Write a funtion that draws a stright spiral given a turtle and the length of the initial side.
- A stright spiral is a sprial like shape made of sides that are straight lines at 90 degree angles to each other. Each side is shorter than the previous side.
- A square spiral might look like this: ![square spiral]({{"/assets/img/a27-0.png" | relative_url}})

`draw_spiral1(t, size, angle)`
- Write a more generic `spiral` function, that will make a turtle draw a sprial shape given an initial side length and the angle it should turn each time.

For reference, here's a list of basic `turtle` commands. They're here as comments so you can paste them to the top of your code, if desired. You can also look at the [official turtle documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#use-object-oriented-turtle-graphics).
```
#    t = turtle.Turtle() # make a new turlte
#    t.fd(<length>)
#        t.fd(100)
#    t.bk(<length>)
#        t.bk(100)
#    t.rt(<angle>)
#        t.rt(45)
#    t.lt(<length>)
#        t.lt(45)
#    t.position() # returns (x, y) coordinates of the turtle
#    t.setx(<x coordinate>)
#        t.setx(0)
#    t.sety(<y coordinate>)
#        t.sety(0)
#    t.color((<red>, <green>, <blue>))
#        t.color((255, 255, 0))
```
