The Koch Curve is a type of [fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal). It can be drawn by a turtle as follows:
- At depth 1, the curve is a straight line
- At depth 2, the curve is:
  - A straight line,
  - followed by a rotation of 60 degrees to the left,
  - followed by another straight line
  - followed by a rotation of 120 degrees to the right
  - followed by another straight line
  - followed by a rotation of 60 degrees to the left
  - followed by one more straight line.
- At depth 3...
  - This gets confusing fast, but look back at the depth 2 description and think _recursively_.
  - Instead of drawing a straight line, think of what you're drawing as another koch curve of one less depth level.

Write `draw_koch(t, depth, length)`, which will instruct turtle `t` to draw a koch curve where each line is `length` long.

Here are some examples with a provided depth:
