The [Sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle) is another fractal that can be drawn in a similar way to the koch curve.
- At depth 1, it is one equilateral triangle.
- At depth 2, it is 3 triangles, each with a side length that is half of the full triangle, positioned next to and on top of each other.
- As with the koch curve, think _recursively_. Instead of drawing a simple triangle, think of what you're drawing as another sierpinski triangle of one less depth level.
- Unlike the koch curve, you need to pay attention to the position and heading of your turtle at the start and end of each depth level. In general, the turtle should end in the exact same position as when it started.

Write `draw_sierpinski(t, depth, length)`, which will instruct turtle `t` to draw a sierpinski triangle where each side is `length` long.

Here are some examples with a provided depth:
- 1: ![sierpinski 1]({{"/assets/img/a25-sierpinski1.png" | relative_url}})
- 2: ![sierpinski 2]({{"/assets/img/a25-sierpinski2.png" | relative_url}})
- 6: ![sierpinski 6]({{"/assets/img/a25-sierpinski6.png" | relative_url}})


Here is an animation of a turtle drawing a sierpinski triangle with depth 5. Notice the way the turtles moves after finishing each triangle.

(If you've been enjoying these, you can look at [this list of fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fractals_by_Hausdorff_dimension) and see if you can recreate any others).
