- `remove_punctuation(s)`
  - Returns a new string that is s with all punctuation removed.
  - `s.replace(a, b)` will replace all occurrences of substring `a` in `s` with the new string, `b`.
  - We will define punctuation as any non-letter, non-number, and non-whitespace character in a string. Look at the full text to Alice in Wonderland to find examples.
  - The one exception is the apostrophe. We will keep it so that contracted words like `isnâ€™t` remain.


- `word_counts(s)`
  * This function will take a string containing text.
  * It will return a dictionary where each key is a word from the parameter, and the values will be the number of times that word appears in the string.
  * Before generating the dictionary, `s` should be converted to lowercase and have all punctuation removed.
  * Example:
    ```
    tobe = 'To be or not to be,\nthat is the question!'
    word_counts(tobe) ==> {'to': 2, 'be': 2, 'or': 1, 'not': 1, 'that': 1, 'is': 1, 'the': 1, 'question': 1}


- `remove_commons(d, common)`
  * This function takes a dictionary of word counts (like what is returned by `word_counts`) and a list of words.
  * It will remove any entry in the dictionary where the key is found in the list of words provided.
  * Example:
    ```
    common = ['the', 'be', 'to', 'of', 'and', 'a', 'in', 'that', 'have', 'i']
    tobe_counts = word_counts(tobe)
    remove_commons(tobe_counts, common)
    print(tobe_counts) ==> {'or': 1, 'not': 1, 'is': 1, 'question': 1}
    ```
