### Test Description
The exam on Friday will focus on the following major topics:
- `split` and `join`
- dictionaries
- Using files as data sources
- Other python topics may also be included.
- The exam will have multiple choice questions and functions to write. It may have other short-answer type questions as well.
- You can check out the [class slides](https://www.stuycs.org/dwlessons/fcs/selector.html) for review.

### Crowd-Sourced Review
You can find all the submitted test questions here: <https://github.com/mks22-dw/dwsource/tree/main/tests/test02>

Pick 4 of the programming questions to complete. At the beginning of each function you write, include the question number above as a comment. Be sure to include test cases with your program.

You are encouraged to work on more problems to prepare for the exam. You should also take a look at the multiple choice questions. I have not vetted all the questions, so there may be mistakes.

### Optional Extra Review
If you want more practice you should check out [coding bat](https://codingbat.com/python). Ignore problems with anything we haven't covered in class.
