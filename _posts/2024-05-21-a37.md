#### Due: {{ page.due }}
#### Submission Name: {{ page.sub_name }}

#### Write the following python function
`create_markov_model(s)`
- `s` Will be a string taken from a large text source.
- Create a markov model based on the text in `s`.
- Each key in the model will be two consecutive words from `s`.
- Each value will be another dictionary:
  - These keys will be the words that follow the original key.
  - These values will be the percentages that those words appear.
- This is the same form of dictionary as the weather example from yesterday.
- I highly suggest you start by building a dictionary with the number of times words appear for all of `s`, then going back over that dictionary and calculating the percentages.
- Example:
```
>>> s = 'to be or not to be that is the question'
>>> m = make_markov_model(s)
>>> pprint(m)
{'be or': {'not': 1.0},
 'be that': {'is': 1.0},
 'is the': {'question': 1.0},
 'not to': {'be': 1.0},
 'or not': {'to': 1.0},
 'that is': {'the': 1.0},
 'to be': {'or': 0.5, 'that': 0.5}}
```

`get_next_word(model, key)`:
- Use the probabilities stored in `model` to return a possible word that should follow `key`.
- This is nearly (or entirely?) identical to `get_next_day` from yesterday's homework.
