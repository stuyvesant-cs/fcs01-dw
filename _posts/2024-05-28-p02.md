#### Project Overview
You (and possibly one or two partners from the same class) are tasked with creating a python program that demonstrates your ability to use the tools covered in class this semester, and understand how to incorporate new tools into your toolbox. As such, each project must contain one of the following two features:
* Using the [matplotlib library](https://matplotlib.org/stable/) to produce graphs and/or charts.
  - Here are some notes on matplotlib: <https://www.stuycs.org/dwlessons/fcs/selector_view.html?slides=25_matplotlib.md#2>
  - This is a demo program that generates a graph using matplotlib and builds a webpage that includes the graph: <https://github.com/mks22-dw/dwsource/tree/main/python_web/plot>
  - You can test this program here: <http://homer.stuy.edu/~jadw/python/plot/plot.py>
* Using python to process input from the web, including using forms and query strings.
  - Here are some notes on HTML forms: <https://www.stuycs.org/dwlessons/fcs/selector_view.html?slides=26_forms.md#2>
  - Check out [here](http://homer.stuy.edu/~jadw/python/hello.html) for a live example, and [hello.html and hello.py](https://github.com/stuycs-gh-classrooms/09-web-jonalf/tree/main/python) for the associated code.
  - [This code](https://github.com/mks22-dw/dwsource/blob/main/python_web/dynaform.py) is very similar to the example above, but it does not have a sepatate HTML file, instead the initial form and the resulting web page are generated by thhe same python program. You can see a live version of the page [here](http://homer.stuy.edu/~jadw/python/dynaform.py)

Here is a list of topics we have covered, many of which should be part of your project.
* Using HTML and CSS to present information as a web page.
* Working with strings in python.
* Using data structures in python (lists and dictionaries).
* Reading files into python programs as data.
* Analyzing data.
* Using recursion to solve problems.
* Using turtles in python.
* Final Projects must contain the following pieces:
  * At least one python program file that produces a valid web page.
  * Substantive usage of lists and/or dictionaries.
  * Substantive use of strings.
  * Reading one or more files through a python program.
  * A webpage that uses HTML and CSS
    - At a minimum, each project should have a webpage, that expalins the purpose of the project. This is in addition to the program that generates a web page.

#### Viable Project Ideas
These are just some ideas to get you started, you do not need to pick one of these, but you are welcome to do so.
* Data Analysis
  * Find some data, read it into your program, process it and display your results as a webpage.
  * You can invest your time and energy in different areas:
    * Data gathering
      * Get multiple pieces of related data (books, songs, player/team sports statistics, etc). Clean the data and allow users to select from different data sets.
    * Data analysis
      * Perform more advanced statistical analysis of the data.
    * Data Presentation/Visualization
      * Show your data in an interesting/novel way.
    * Searchable Database
      * Instead of focusing on analyzing data, create a website that makes it easy to view and search from a large dataset.
* Online form generator
  * Create a simple language for users to generate their own online forms.
  * Example format: Type of question, question text, answer options (if applicable).
  * Your program could either generate the html for the form based on a text file or web form based input.
* Choose-your-own-adventure generator
  * Similar to the form generator, this would take in (either vie a web form or text file) a choose your own adventure story, broken into pieces with choices that link to other specific sections.
  * Your program would then generate all the webpages to make the story functional.


#### Project Guidelines:
* Your project should focus on the technologies covered in class.
* This means python, html and css not, for example, javascript.
* Your grade will depend on several factors beyond the actual project:
  * Your prototype/documentation/submissions
  * Consistent work throughout the allotted time. (The procrastination penalty)
  * You should try to get the minimum requirements done early.
  * It is ok if someone goes above and beyond, as long as the other partner contributes a substantial amount. It is NOT ok if one partner does most of the work, and the other does very little.
