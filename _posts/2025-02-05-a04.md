- I've also included links to documentation for each tag you need to use below.


#### Write a real Web Page
Write a simple html file, properly formatted (which means include the non-visible html tags like `DOCTYPE` `html`  `head` and `body`), that uses the following elements (you can include others if you'd like):
 * [heading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements): `<h1>`
 * [anchor (link)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a): `<a>`
 * [list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul): `<ul>` and `<li>`
 * [image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img): `<img>`

#### Submission Notes
Make sure your page is in your `public_html` directory on your school computer __and__ added to your github repository as well. If you work on this from home, you'll need to get your work into `public_html` at school. How can you do that? Via the command line of course! `scp` stands for _secure copy_ and can be used to send files over the internet using the _ssh_ protocol.
1. Open your terminal program (extra tip for those using gitbash below).
2. Use `cd` to navigate to the directory that contains your file.
3. Use `scp` to send the file.
   - `$ scp FILE USERNAME@homer.stuy.edu:public_html/` Will upload `FILE` into your `public_html` directory.
   - Example: `$ scp hello.html dw@homer.stuy.edu:public_html/`
   - If this is the first time you are using `scp` or `ssh` to connect to homer (which it probably is), you will get a warning that starts with: `The authenticity of host 'homer.stuy.edu (149.89.150.100)' can't be established.`, respond to the question with `yes`.
   - Next you will be prompted for your password.
   - Then the file will be transferred.
4. You can test that the transfer was successful by loading your webpage in a browser.

If you're using gitbash, the easiest way to make sure you're in the correct directory is to right click on the directory in your GUI and select "Open in gitbash". This should open a new Gitbash terminal and immediately set your working directory correctly.
