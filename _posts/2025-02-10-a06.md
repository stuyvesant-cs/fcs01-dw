#### CSS Time
Create a css file called `hello_style.css` in your web repository. This will be a style file used on your webpage for `hello.html` (from work_04).
- In this file you must set at least one css property for each element in `hello.html` (except for `head` and anything in `head`).
- This file should have at least one example for each of the properties [in this table](https://www.stuycs.org/dwlessons/fcs/selector_view.html?slides=05_css.md#19).
- Add your css file to the html file `hello.html`.

#### Notes About Working From Home
- Your home computer is probably not set up as a webserver, this is fine, but it means you'll have to work a little differently than at school. First off, you will need a text editor and a web browser. I suggest [pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/download.html#regular-releases) as your text editor. You must use a plain text editor, so something like word or google docs is __NOT__ acceptable.
- Open your HTML and CSS files in your text editor, this is where you will edit them.
- Also open your HTML (not the CSS, it will be included via the HTML file) in your web browser. Open it via the _Open File_ option in the File menu of your browser. The address bar will start with: `file:///` followed by the path to your HTML file.
- As you edit your CSS, reload the HTML file in the browser. You may need to do a force reload (on firefox, that's ctrl-shift-r)
