You can find all the submitted test questions here: <https://github.com/mks22-dw/thesource/tree/main/test0>

Pick 4 of the short answer questions to complete. At the beginning of each question you answer, include the question number above. Since this will be a mix of command line instructions, html and css, put your answers in a plain text file.

You are encouraged to work on more problems to prepare for the exam. You should also take a look at the multiple choice questions. I have not vetted all the questions, so there may be mistakes.
