#### Write the following functions in python.
- `max3`
  - Has three parameters representing numbers.
  - __Returns__ the largest value of the three parameters.

- `distance`
  - Takes 4 parameters representing 2 `(x, y)` points.
  - Assume the order is `(x0, y0, x1, y1)`
  - __Returns__ the distance between the two points.
  - Use the distance formula: sqrt( (x1 - x0)<sup>2</sup> + (y1 - y0)<sup>2</sup>)

* `closer_point`
  - Takes 6 inputs, each pair of inputs represents the (x, y) coordinates of a point on the cartesian plane.
    - Assume the order is `(x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2)`
  - __Prints__ out which of the first two points is closer to the third point.
  - If both points are equidistant, print a message stating they are the same distance.
  - Sample output: `(10, 10) is closer to (0, 0)`

- `is_leap_year`
  - Takes one parameter representing a year. Prints out if the provided year is a leap year or not.
  -  Years divisible by 4 are leap years _except_ if they are divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400.
  - Samples output: `2024 is a leap year`.
