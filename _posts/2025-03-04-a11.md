#### Due: {{ page.due }}
#### Submission Name: {{ page.sub_name }}

#### Task
1. Go to <http://projecteuler.net/problems>
2. Use python to solve problems 1, 6 and 5
   - Make note of the order, question 5 is harder than question 6.
3. If you've completed them, work on more.

Sample output:
```
problem 1
23: 23
233168: 233168

problem 6
2640: 2640
25164150: 25164150
```

#### Important Notes
- Your completed assignment should have functions and test cases in it, at least one function per question.
- The functions you write should __return__ the answer.
- Some of these problems are simple, many of them are difficult.
- For some of these problems it will be quite helpful to write multiple functions.
* SUPER HELPFUL CODING TIP
  * Use `print` statements inside your loops to see what is happening to your variables
  * Some of your loops may intentionally go on for a while
