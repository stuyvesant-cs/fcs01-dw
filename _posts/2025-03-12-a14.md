### Test Description
The exam on Friday will cover the following major topics (skill list at the bottom of this post):
- Python basics (variables, types, operators, functions)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`)
- While loops
- String basics (`len`, `find`, indexing, `ord`, `chr`)
- The exam will have multiple choice questions and functions to write. It may have other short-answer type questions as well.

### Write Possible Test Questions
With your write three potential test questions.
1. The first two should be multiple choice questions with 4 options.
2. The third should be a function to program.
  - This should be similar to the programming work you have had so far. Include all the information needed to write the function (formulas, etc).

Put both questions, and the answers in a python file. You can put multiple lines together in a single comment using `""" .... """`. Use this format:

```
