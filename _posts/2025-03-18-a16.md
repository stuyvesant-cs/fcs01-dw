# Write the following functions in python.
__For all of these functions, only use methods/structures we're covered in class.__
- `make_list_to_n(n)`
  - Make and return a list of integers of all integers from `1` to `n` inclusive. They should be in increasing order.
    - `make_list_to_n(0)` → `[]`
    - `make_list_to_n(1)` → `[1]`
    - `make_list_to_n(3)` → `[1, 2, 3]`

- `power_list(b, n)`
  - Make and return a list of the powers of `b` from `1` to `n`, inclusive.
  - `power_list(2, 5)` -> `[2, 4, 8, 16, 32]`

- `make_sentence(g)`
  - Assume `g` is a list containing strings that are non-empty and do not start or end with space
  - Take all of the strings in `g`, and combine them into one string, separated by spaces. Return that string
  - `make_sentence([])` → `''`
  - `make_sentence(['bob'])` → `'bob'`
  - `make_sentence(['hot', 'dog'])` → `'hot dog'`

- `join_list(g, s)`
  - Assume `g` is a list and `s` is a string.
  - Return a string containing all the elements of `g`, separated by `s`.
  - `join_list([4, 18, 2], '-')` -> `'4-18-2'`
  - `join_list([1, 2, 3, 4], ' potato ')` -> `'1 potato 2 potato 3 potato 4'`
<!--
 makeFibList
  - Make a list of the Fibonacci numbers up to the nth term. The 0'th element is 0, the 1st is 1.
  - makeFibList(0) → [0]
  - makeFibList(1) → [0, 1]
  - makeFibList(2) → [0, 1, 1]
