As always, you only need the tools we've discussed in class to solve these problems. If you use anything from outside of class, it should not trivialize (do the entire problem) for you. For example, Problem 2 involves finding the average of a list of value, there is a python function that does this, don't use it.  

Sample output:
```
==========Problem 0==========
list a:  10 [4, 7, 4, 1, 7, 9, 9, 7, 5, 5]
list b:  10 [0, 7, 9, 4, 2, 3, 8, 9, 9, 5]
==========Problem 1==========
test list:
0: =========
1: =====
2: =====
3: ===
4: =

==========Problem 2==========
test list (5.7): 5.7
list a: 5.8
list b 5.6
==========Problem 3==========
test list (4): 4
==========Problem 4==========
test list (5): 5
list a: 7
list b: 9
==========Problem 5==========
test list ([0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 1, 1, 2]): [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 1, 1, 2]
list a: [0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 0, 2]
list b: [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 3]
list c (values [0, 5) ): [3, 4, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0, 2]
list c counts: [2, 1, 1, 4, 2]
