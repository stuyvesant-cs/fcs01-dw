Here is a string of the names of all the Major League Baseball teams, copy this into a python program:
```
teams = '''Los Angeles Angels

San Francisco Giants
Tampa Bay Rays
Miami Marlins
Chicago Cubs
Chicago White Sox
Kansas City Royals
St. Louis Cardinals
New York Mets
New York Yankees
Cincinnati Reds

Philadelphia Phillies
Pittsburgh Pirates
Houston Astros
Texas Rangers

Colorado Rockies

```
Write a program that performs the following tasks:
1. Create a list of team names.
2. Create a list that contains the length of each of the team names.
3. Find the average team name length.
4. Create a list containing only the team names less than the average length.
5. Create a list containing only the team names longer than the average length.
6. Create a list that contains the number of words in each team name.
   - So `New York Yankees` would be 3, while `Detroit Tigers` would be 2
   - `s.count(' ')` will return the number of times a space appears in string `s`. This will be helpful
7. Find the number of teams with 2 word names.
8. Find the number of teams with 3 word names.
9. Create a random team name by taking any of the two word team names and combining a random city/state with a random title i.e. "Minnesota Pirates"
