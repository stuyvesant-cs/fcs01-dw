At the bottom of this assignment you will see a long python string definition. Each line of the string contains statistics for a New York Yankees hitter form the 2024 baseball season. The lines will look like this:
```
Aaron Judge,CF,559,122,180,36,1,58,144
```
The first line provides the description of each value in the player string:
```
Player,Position,At Bats,Runs,Hits,2B,3B,HR,RBI
```
Write a python program that uses the provided string to create an [HTML table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) based on that string (see work 17 for more details on tables). Your table should contain:
- A header row based on the first line of the string.
- Rows for each player.
  - In addition to the provided values, include each player's batting average, which can be computed by dividing the `At Bats` by the  `Hits`.
- An extra row at the bottom which includes the total values for the team for all the statistics. Calculate a team batting average.
