### Write Possible Test Questions
With your write three potential test questions.
1. The first two should be multiple choice questions with 4 options.
2. The third should be a function to program.
  - This should be similar to the programming work you have had so far. Include all the information needed to write the function (formulas, etc).

Put both questions, and the answers in a python file. You can put multiple lines together in a single comment using `""" .... """`. Use this format:

```
