You can find all the submitted test questions here: <https://github.com/mks22-dw/thesource/tree/main/test2>

Pick 4 of the short answer questions to complete. At the beginning of each question you answer, include the question number as a comment.

You are encouraged to work on more problems to prepare for the exam. You should also take a look at the multiple choice questions. I have not vetted all the questions, so there may be mistakes.
