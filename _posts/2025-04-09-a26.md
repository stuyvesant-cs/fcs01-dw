A fractal tree creates a pattern of branches recursively. Like the sierpinski triangle, it is important to keep track of the position of your turtle while drawing a tree.
- The turtle should always end is the same position as where it started. This includes the location and heading.
- At depth 1, a "tree" is just a trunk (straight line).
- At depth 2, a tree is a trunk followed by 2 depth-1 trees. One tree to the right of the trunk and one to the left. The angle between the trunk a the subtrees can be provided as a parameter.


Write `tree(t, depth, length, angle)`, which will instruct turtle `t` to draw a fractal tree triangle where each branch is `length` long and each subtree is separated by `angle` degrees from its trunk.

Here are some examples with a provided depth, each uses 30 for `angle`:
- 1: ![tree 1]({{"/assets/img/a29-0.png" | relative_url}})
- 2: ![tree 2]({{"/assets/img/a29-1.png" | relative_url}})
- 3: ![tree 3]({{"/assets/img/a29-2.png" | relative_url}})


Here is an animation of a turtle drawing a fractal tree with depth 4.
