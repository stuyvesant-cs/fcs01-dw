Write a function that will print out instructions on how to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem, so the monks won't need to think so much, and can focus on enlightenment instead.
* `hanoi(n, start, middle, end)`
  * e.g. `hanoi(4, 0, 1, 2)`
* Assume there are three towers, numbered 0, 1 and 2.
* The goal is to get all the disks from tower 0 to tower 2.
* Each printed line should be of the form: `tower_a to tower_b` denoting moving the top disk from `tower_a` to `tower_b`. For example, the solution for n=1 would be:
    * `0 to 2`
* The solution for n=3 would be:

    ```
0 to 2
0 to 1
2 to 1
0 to 2
1 to 0
1 to 2
0 to 2
    ```

* In order to test your solution you can use this website: <http://homer.stuy.edu/~dw/hanoi/>{:target="_blank"}
  1. Select the number of disks and towers you want.
  2. Click the _Re-initialize_ button.
  3. Paste your printed out instructions into the text box.
  4. Click the _play moves_ button.
    * To make them move faster, set the _speed_ slider to a smaller value (it's more of a delay between moves slider, so the bigger the value, the longer it takes.).
