### Make a Data Directory
Since we will be working with external text files a lot over the next couple of weeks, you should create a directory called `data/` in your github repository. For this assignment, we'll be working with [Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/pg11.txt). You should download (after opening the link in your browser, go to the File menu and select "Save As") the book and save it to this directory.  

### Write a python program
Some of these functions should work with any text, while others will be based off of using the copy of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland you have downloaded. For this assignment, you will be using the same text source for everything.

- `get_chars_after(s, key, n)`
  - Return a string containing `n` characters starting from the first time `key` appears in `s`.
  - If `key` is not in `s`, return the empty string.


- `word_count(s, key)`
  - Return how many times `key` appears in `s`.

- `get_words_after(s, key, n)`
  - Return a string containing `n` __words__ starting from the first time `key` appears in `s`.
  - If `key` is not in `s`, return the empty string.

- `get_chapter(s, chapter)`
  - Return the entire text of chapter `chapter` form `s`.
  - Assume `chapter` is a roman numeral `I` to `XII`.
  - Look at the book so you're clear how the chapters are structured, note that chapter 13 ends with `THE END`

Write a python program that opens and reads Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and uses that text to test the functions above.
