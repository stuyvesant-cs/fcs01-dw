`lists2dict(g0, g1)`
* Takes 2 lists of equal size, and returns a dictionary where the keys are the elements of `g0` and the values are the elements of `g1`.
* Example:
  * `lists2dict(['v', 'viii', 'iv'], ['empire strikes back', 'force awakens', 'new hope'])` ==> `{'v': 'empire strikes back', 'viii': 'force awakens', 'iv': 'new hope'}`


`better_hitters(team, cutoff)`
* This function will take a dictionary where the keys are baseball player names and the values will be their current batting average, and a number representing the batting average for the entire league.
* The function will return a list of player names with averages above or equal to the cutoff average.
* exmaple:
  ```
  yankees = {'volpe': .250,
           'soto': .329,
           'judge': .222,
           'tores': .216,
           'rizzo': .265,
           'stanton': .227,
           'verdugo': .275,
           'trevino': .281,
            'cabrera': .250}
  better_hitters(yankees, .275) ==> [soto', 'verdugo', 'trevino']
  ```

`word_counts(s)`
* `s` is a string containing english text (like the text of a book).
* Returns a dictionary where each key is a unique word from `s`, and the values are the number of times that word appears in `s`.
* For the moent, assume that words can be easily found by splitting a string on any whitespace.
* Use Alice's adventures in wonderland, or another book, to test.
* Here are the first few entries from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland:
  - `{'Aliceâ€™s': 11, 'Adventures': 2, 'in': 346, 'Wonderland': 2, 'by': 54, `...
