#### Test Prep
See below for the specific skills to be included on tomorrow's exam. Instead of our normal test review procedures, we will use yesterday's assignment as a guide. Break up the assignment into the following functions:
- `make_temp_list(text)`
  - Create a list of temperature values from string `text`, which should be the contents of the nyc weather data file.
  - Sample return value:

    ```
    [42, 39, 44, 30, 42, 35, 42, 39, 42, 28, 30, 35, 32, 37, 35, ...
    ```
- `make_temp_counts(temps)`
  - Create a dictionary that is close to the markov model, but instead of containing the probabilities of each temperature, it only contains the number of times that temperature appeared (this is both simpler than the probabilities, and necessary to generate the probabilities).
  - Assume that `temps` is a list of temperature values only.
  - Sample return value:

    ```
    {42: {39: 4, 35: 3, 28: 1, 51: 3, 46: 4, 44: 5, 42: 12, 33: 2, 26: 1, 48: 4, 50: 1, 55: 1, 32: 1, 60: 1, 41: 2, 57: 1},
    39: {44: 2, 42: 6, 39: 6, 37: 4, 33: 1, 28: 2, 32: 1, 35: 3, 48: 3, 41: 1, 53: 1, 46: 2, 30: 1}
    ...
    ```

- `make_temp_markov(counts)`
  - Generate the markov model dictionary given the dictionary created by `make_temp_counts`.
  - Sample return value:

    ```
    {42: {39: 0.08695652173913043, 35: 0.06521739130434782, 28: 0.021739130434782608, 51: 0.06521739130434782, 46: 0.08695652173913043, 44: 0.10869565217391304, 42: 0.2608695652173913, 33: 0.043478260869565216, 26: 0.021739130434782608, 48: 0.08695652173913043, 50: 0.021739130434782608, 55: 0.021739130434782608, 32: 0.021739130434782608, 60: 0.021739130434782608, 41: 0.043478260869565216, 57: 0.021739130434782608},
    39: {44: 0.06060606060606061, 42: 0.18181818181818182, 39: 0.18181818181818182, 37: 0.12121212121212122, 33: 0.030303030303030304, 28: 0.06060606060606061, 32: 0.030303030303030304, 35: 0.09090909090909091, 48: 0.09090909090909091, 41: 0.030303030303030304, 53: 0.030303030303030304, 46: 0.06060606060606061, 30: 0.030303030303030304}
    ...
    ```

- If you get all this working, you could try the following:
  - Instead of using all the temperatures, only select the highest value if there are multiple entries for a given day.
  - Use two consecutive temperature values as keys in the main dictionary.
