I will not be looking at the CSS skill for this lab, _but_ if you want to add significant CSS, I will evaluate it for the purposes of skill 29.

As always, you only need the tools we've discussed in class to solve these problems. If you use anything from outside of class, it should not trivialize (do the entire problem) for you. For example, Problem 2 involves finding the average of a list of value, there is a python function that does this, don't use it.
