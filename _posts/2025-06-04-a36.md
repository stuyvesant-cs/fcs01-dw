#### Create a (better) Random Website!
- Write a python program that will generate random text using a markov chain from a source, or sources, of your choosing (if you still need help with markov chains, you can find working versions of the first two markov chain assignments in [thesouce](https://github.com/mks22-dw/thesource/tree/main/python)).
- This program should use that text as the content for a web page, applying HTML tags where needed and appropriate.
- Place this program in your `~/public_html/py/` directory, and test that it works as a web page in a browser.
- You may want to process the text furtehr to make it more aesthetically pleasing (start with a capital letter, include paragraphs, etc.)
