1. Make sure you completed your CodingBat setup from Work 7.
2. Do the problems located here: <https://codingbat.com/home/dw@stuy.edu/lists-0>{:target="_blank"}
3. In addition completing the problems on CodingBat, use a plain text editor to copy all the functions you write into a single file, and give it the extension __.py__. Submit that using the homework server. You could also use Thonny if you like.
