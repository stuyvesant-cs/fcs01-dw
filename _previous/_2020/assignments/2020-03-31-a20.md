Write a function that will translate a string into pirate speak using the following rules:
  * you --> ye
  * your -->yer
  * the --> t'
  * i, my, mine --> me
  * am, is, are, 're --> be
  * myself --> meself
  * for -->fer

You can assume the input string has only lowercase letters. You can also ignore instances where one of the replacement words is attached to a punctuation mark.

You should use both `split` and `join` in your function.

Example:
  ```
  >>> s = """
  may i introduce myself i am quite pleased to make your aquaintence.
  my aim is for us to have a mutually beneficial arrangement.
  you are encouraged to be clear about your terms, as I will be about mine own.
  """
  >>> print(pirate(s))
  may me introduce meself me be quite pleased to make yer aquaintence. me aim be fer us to have a mutually beneficial arrangement. ye be encouraged to clear about yer terms, as I will be about me own.
  ```

If you want more of a challenge (not required!):
  * Include 'Arrr!' after every other sentence
  * Exclamation point at the end of each sentence.
  * words that end with ing --> end with in'
  * account for capitalization.
  * account for words that include punctuation
