# Write the following functions in python.

* `upcase`
  - Takes a single character string as an argument and returns the upper case version of it.
  - If the string does not contain a letter, or it already is upper case, return the original string.
  - Examples:
    ```
    upcase(‘C’) ==> ‘C’
    upcase(‘3’) ==> ‘3’
    ```
* `upstring`
  - Takes a string as an argument, and returns a copy of the string where all the lower case letters are capitalized.
  - Examples:
    ```
    upstring(‘hello’) ==> ‘HELLO’
    upstring(‘What’s up?’) ==> ‘WHAT’S UP?’
    ```
