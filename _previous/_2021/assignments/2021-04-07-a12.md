# Write the following functions in python.
* `count`
  * Using a `for` loop, write a function that will return the number of times a specific element appears in a collection.
    * Examples:
      * `count(4, [1, 2, 3, 4]) ==> 1`
      * `count('a', 'abracadabra') ==> 5`

* `doublify`
  - Using `for`, write a function that will take a list of numbers and return a new list that contains the values from the parameter list doubled.
    - Example: `doublify([6, 3, -8, 3.5]) ==> [12, 6, -16, 7]`

* `add_ten`
  * Write a function that takes a list of numbers and adds 10 to each element. The function should not return anything.
  * Example:
    ```
    g = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    add_ten(g)
    print(g)
    # Should print [11, 12, 13, 14]
    ```
  * Think before you code: should you use `for` in this function?

* `zip_lists`
  - Write a function that accepts two lists as parameters and returns a new list.
  - The returned list should have the elements in alternating order that is:
    - `a[0]`, then `b[0]`, then `a[1]`, then `b[1]` ... until you run out of elements.
  - When one list is empty, then the remaining elements from the other list should be put at the end.
  - Examples:
    ```
    zipLists( [1,2,3] , ['a','b'] ) ==> [1,'a',2,'b',3]
    zipLists( [1,2] , [5,5,5,5] )   ==> [1,5,2,5,5,5]
    zipLists( [1] , [] )            ==> [1]
    ```
