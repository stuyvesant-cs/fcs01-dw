# Create a python file that generates the following graphs
* Borough Population Graph
  - Using the data from the [nyc population file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mks22-dw/python/main/nyc_pop.csv), pick a borough and create a bar graph with ppoulation data for that borough in a 100 year span (this should result in 10 bars).
  - You can either read in the data file and manipulate it programatically, or copy and paste in just the relavant data.
  - Add axis labels & a title.
* Manhattan Rents
  - I found a dataset of ~3500 Manhattan rent values. You can get it [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mks22-dw/python/main/manhattan_rent.csv).
    - The data has rent price, apartment size, number of bedrooms.
  - In the same python program as your bar graph above:
    - Open and read in the rent file.
    - Create 2 histograms
      - Square footage
      - Price
    - Play around with bin sizes for your 2 graphs. Pick what you think is best.
