Remember, all website work should be in your web repository:
- Period 9 GH Classroom link: <https://classroom.github.com/a/uM_xihHm>
- Period 10 GH Classroom link: <https://classroom.github.com/a/YUn44KQM>

#### Helpful resources:
- [Template HTML page](https://github.com/mks22-dw/dwsource/blob/main/html/template.html)
- [Table of common elements from notes](https://www.stuycs.org/dwlessons/fcs/selector_view.html?slides=05_html.md#22)
- I've also included links to documentation for each tag you need to use below.


#### Write a real Web Page
Write a simple html file, properly formatted (which means include the non-visible html tags like `DOCTYPE` `html`  `head` and `body`), that uses the following elements (you can include others if you'd like):
 * [heading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements): `<h1>`
 * [anchor (link)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a): `<a>`
 * [list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul): `<ul>` and `<li>`
 * [image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img): `<img>`

#### Submission Notes
Make sure your page is in your `public_html` directory on your school computer __and__ added to your github repository as well. If you work on this from home, after you've uploaded your changes to GitHub, you'll have to pull them onto your local home directory at school. How do you do that? The magic of `ssh`:
- First, open the command line environment on your computer.
  - On a MacOS or Linux computer, open the __Terminal__ program.
  - On a Windows computer, open the __Command Prompt__ program.
- Connect to a stuycs server using ssh.
  - Use the following command: `$ ssh USER@homer.stuy.edu` replace `USER` with your cs lab username.
  - Enter your password when prompted (you may also need to agree that you trust the server).
  - If this worked, then you will have a command line identical to one you would open up using the terminal at school.
- cd into your public_html directory and use `$ git pull` to download any changes from GitHub.
- If you cannot connect to homer, you can try these servers instead:
  - `$ ssh USER@bart.stuy.edu`
  - `$ ssh USER@lisa.stuy.edu`
  - `$ ssh USER@marge.stuy.edu`
