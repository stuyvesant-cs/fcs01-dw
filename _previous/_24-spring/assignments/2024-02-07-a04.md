Remember, all website work should be in your web repository:
- Period 9 GH Classroom link: <https://classroom.github.com/a/uM_xihHm>
- Period 10 GH Classroom link: <https://classroom.github.com/a/YUn44KQM>

#### Helpful resources:
- [Template HTML page](https://github.com/mks22-dw/dwsource/blob/main/html/template.html)
- [Table of common elements from notes](https://www.stuycs.org/dwlessons/fcs/selector_view.html?slides=05_html.md#22)
- I've also included links to documentation for each tag you need to use below.


#### Create an Index Page for your Websites
Create a new html file names `index.html`. This file should contain the following things, in order:
- Your name (`h1`).
- Your class period (`h2`)
- A list of the assignments in your `public_html` directory. Each list item should be a clickable link to the assignment file. You will update this list as we add more web pages, but at this time, you should have the following files:
  - hello.html (the basic text file disguised as html)
  - w03.html (the file that demonstrates tags)
  - index.html (this new file).
You should also take this opportunity to make sure that the work you have is in the correct place and that you are using github correctly.
