#### RESET YOUR BRAIN
- This is your second python assignment.
- While there are many ways to write/run ptyhon code, I strongly suggest your download and install [Thonny](https://thonny.org/).
- This should __NOT__ be in your web (public_html) repository. USe the other work repository created for assingment 01.

#### Write the following functions in python.
- `test_1(f, expected, i)`
  - Tests a function that has 1 parameter.
  - Takes as parameters a function, expected return value, and parameter.
  - Evaluates the provided function on the provided input. Prints out a message as to whether or not the function worked as expected.
  - Returns `True` or `False` based on if the provided function worked as expected.
  - Sample usage: `test_1(f_to_c, 0, 32)`
- `test_4(f, expected, i0, i1, i2, i3)`
  - Tests a function that has 4 parameters.
  - Works the same way as `test_1`, just with more parameters
  - Sample usage: `test_4(distance, 5.0, 3, 0, 0, 4)`
- Use the functions from yesterday's assignment to test, you can refer to the [posted solutions](https://github.com/mks22-dw/dwsource/blob/main/python/w07_funcs.py) if you want.
