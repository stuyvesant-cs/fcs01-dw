### Test Description
The exam on Thursday will focus on the following major topics:
- String slicing
- Lists
- `for` loops
- `map`, `filter` and `reduce`
- Other python topics may also be included.
- The exam will have multiple choice questions and functions to write. It may have other short-answer type questions as well.

### Write Possible Test Questions
With your TableBuddy™ write two potential test questions.
1. The first should be a multiple choice questions with 4 options.
2. The second one should be a function to program.
  - This should be similar to the programming work you have had so far. Include all the information needed to write the function (formulas, etc).

Put both questions, and the answers in a python file. You are working with your TableBuddy™, but both of you need to submit this file. You can put multiple lines together in a single comment using `""" .... """`. Use this format:

```
