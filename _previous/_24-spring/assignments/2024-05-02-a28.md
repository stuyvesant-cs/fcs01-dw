### Write the following python functions
`get_values`
* This function will take a string containing numbers separated by spaces (`' '`) and return a list where each value is a number from the string, but represented as numbers, strings.
* example:
  - `get_values('90 99 97 89')` ==> `[90, 99, 97, 89]`

`get_vals_list`
* This function will take a string with numbers, spaces, and newlines like this:
```
s = """90 99 97 89
91 94 99 89
81 94 100 100
90 99 79 81
50 79 49 41
90 99 94 94"""
```
* It should return a list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to a line in the original string, and each value is an number represented as a number, not a string.
* example
  `gat_vals_list(s)` ==>
    ```
    [[90, 99, 97, 89],
    [91, 94, 99, 89],
    [81, 94, 100, 100],
    [90, 99, 79, 81],
    [50, 79, 49, 41],
    [90, 99, 94, 94]]
    ```

`get_averages`
* This function will take a list of lists of numbers (like what `get_vals_list` returns) and return a list of averages for each sublist.
* protip: there is a function `sum(g)` that will return the sum of the elements in `g`, as long as `g` only contains numbers.
* example
  `get_averages(get_vals_list(s))` ==> `[93.75, 93.25, 93.75, 87.25, 54.75, 94.25]`

<!--
`numlist_to_string`
* This function will take a list of numbers, and return an string where each value is separated by a comma.
* example
  `numlist_to_string([90, 99, 97, 89])` ==> `'90,99,97,89'`

`combine_data`
* This function will take a string formatted like `s` above.
* Will return a string where the values for each line are separated by `,` followed by a `:` and the averages value for that line.
* example
  `print(combine_data(s))` ==>
    ```
    90,99,97,89: 93.75
    91,94,99,89: 93.25
    81,94,100,100: 93.75
    90,99,79,81: 87.25
    50,79,49,41: 54.75
    90,99,94,94: 94.25
    ```
