On the source code repository you will find a file named [cs_lab.py](https://github.com/mks22-dw/dwsource/blob/main/python/csv_lab.py). It is formatted like a lab and contains a number of functions to write that involve working with text, lists and dictionaries. While I am not assigning it as a lab, working through the questions is exactly what will help you get more practice with these topics and prepare you for Friday's exam. Therefore I am assigning it as homework and giving you a couple days to work on it.
- You will also need the [nyc population data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mks22-dw/dwsource/main/python/data/nyc_pop.csv) file to complete the assignment.
