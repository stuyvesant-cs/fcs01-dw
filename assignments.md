### Important Notes

All Assignments will be submitted via GitHub classroom. Labs and projects will have their own assignment links, all homeworks should be submitted in the homework repository.

If you did not receive credit (see a 0 on jupiter) for an assignment that you completed, [fill out this form](). This includes if you submitted work late for an absence or otherwise. _DO NOT__ fill out this form if the assignment doesnâ€™t appear on jupiter at all.
