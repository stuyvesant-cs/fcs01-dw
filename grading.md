## Overview
This course will be using __skills based__ grading, meaning that a student's grade will be solely based on their ability to prove competency of the core skills covered throughout the course. Some key components of this grading framework are:

- All skills will be rated on a 0-4 scale.
- Students will be given multiple opportunities to show mastery of each skill.
- The skills will be clearly listed on the course syllabus.
- Skill grades will be based on assessments (exams, quizzes, projects, labs, etc) __only__.
  - Assessments will be clearly noted when assigned.
- Homework, classwork, entrance/exit tickets and other assignment types will be given, but will not factor into a students skill grade.

## Assignment Types
### Homework And Classwork
The purpose of these assignments is for students to practice, discover and try things out. These assignments are _vital elements_ of a student's path to skill mastery. These are not included in a students grade because they are not designed to assess skills but rather to hone them. Student's grades should not be affected by how long or quickly it takes to complete. Students should also not be discouraged from trying out something different, exploring new possibilities or even failure to complete these assignments, as all of those activities are integral to learning and eventually mastering skills.

These assignments will also provide the teacher with important information about the current abilities of each student and the class as a whole. These assignments will not be graded, but they will be used in class, solutions may be provided, and feedback will be given as often as needed and possible.

### Assessments
All assessments are designed to assess a students skill competency. It will be clear which skills are to be assessed for a given assessment. Instead of a single grade for an assignment (i.e. 92/100, 41/50, 3.5/4), students will be given a single grade for each skill assessed on a 0 - 4 scale as follows:

- 4: Mastery of the skill demonstrated.
- 3: Competency of the skill demonstrated.
- 2: Developing competency of the skill demonstrated.
- 1: Minimal competency of the skill demonstrated.
- 0: No part of the skill demonstrated.

#### Exams & Quizzes
Exams and quizzes will be _in class_ assessments taking the course of a period (or part of a period for quizzes). Students are not to work collaboratively or share information about the exam/quiz to any other student.

#### Lab Assignments
Lab assignments will be programming tasks that may include both in and out of class time to complete. Students must submit their own work, though they may use class-approved resources (including notes, classmates, CS Dojo) to complete the assignments. Rubrics detailing what skills will be assessed and what constitutes a particular grade for each skill will be provided for each lab.

#### Projects
Projects will be larger-scale assignments. Students will be given more time to complete the work than labs, and specific time will be set aside for planning and design, in addition to the project itself. Rubrics detailing what skills will be assessed and what constitutes a particular grade for each skill will be provided for each project.

#### Final Project and/or Exam
The course will culminate in a final assessment that will take the form of an exam, project, or both. The final(s) will assess all the skills for the course.

## Late Assessment Submissions
- Late labs and projects will be allowed within reason.
  - If a submission is deemed too late (i.e. after solutions have been posted, after marking period grades are due, etc.), there will be other opportunities to assess skill competency.
- Since homework and classwork are not included in a students grade, that late work will not be penalized.

## Retakes/Retests/Redos
All students will be given multiple attempts to demonstrate competency of each skill. This can take many different forms, including(but not limited to) the following:

- Re-submission of an assessment.
- Re-taking an exam.
- Submitting corrections/explanations of incorrect answers.
- Submitting a similar (but not identical) assessment.
- Taking a similar (but not identical) exam.
- Not allowing retakes or resubmissions, but instead using skill grades from other (previous or later) assessments.

## Final Grade Calculation
A student's final grade should reflect their demonstrated skill competency level from throughout the semester, including how well they've maintained those skills through to the end. A student's skill grade will consist of their skill level demonstrated over the course of the semester __and__ their skill level demonstrated on the final assessment(s):

Final grades will take the average of all of a student's individual skill grades and map that to a 100 point grading scale as follows:

- 4: 100
- 3: 90
- 2: 75
- 1: 55

# Skills for  Foundations of Computer Science
_N.B._ This list may change slightly over the course of the semester. Any changes will be made clearly during class and updated here as well.
