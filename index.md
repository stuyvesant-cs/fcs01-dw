## Your Responsibilities:
  0. Be a good human being!
      * Treat each other (and me) with respect and kindness.
      * Take care of the classroom and the equipment contained within.
      * Be courteous to your classmates.
  1. Come to class!
      * "80% of success is showing up."
      * If you're not here, you can't learn, and you can't work with your classmates.
      * If you are absent or late, have a note ready.
      * A large portion of this class involves working in groups, if you're not here, you are letting your group down.
      * If you are absent for a test, you must have a note from your parent/guardian in order to make it up.
  2. Do the work!
      * There will be homework/classwork assignments and large projects.
      * All work/projects will be submitted online.
      * *work assignments
        * These are small nightly-ish assignments.
        * Some of these will be pair assignments, be prepared to work with others.
        * Solutions to these assignments will always be posted afterwards.
        * This may vary, but will generally be 1-3 days after the assignment is due. Once a solution is posted, you cannot receive late credit.
        * You cannot submit all missed work at the end of the semester or marking period and expect to get credit.
      * Projects
        * There will be 2-3 large projects during the semester.
        * They may be group projects.
        * You will have time in class to work on them, but they will require outside work as well.
        * Projects will count the same as tests.
      * Tests
        * There will be 4-6 exams during the semester, as well as a final exam.
        * Tests will be done on paper, with no electronic assistance.
        * The class day before a test will have review time, but you must come armed with questions!
        * CS tests are commonly on Friday, unless the school schedule changes.
      * My goal is to not overburden you with work, but that means that missing an assignment in this class will have a larger impact on your grade than missing an assignment in a class with nightly homework (because that's how math works).
      * Submit your own work. Anyone caught plagiarizing will receive a 0 for the assignment along with further disciplinary action as required by school policy (Check out [How to compsci at stuy](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1I93Pegu_PfTj9s6BXwE98GuBcRIFp3l1yimw5YTRAWw/pub#h.h3rzevnp1gi7) if you need a refresher on academic dishonesty).
  3. The only way to fail this class is to violate the previous 2 points (I cannot give poor grades for not being a good human being, but there are much larger repercussions for failing in that area that will last much longer than a high school class grade).

## My Responsibilities:
  0. Be a good human being.
  1. Create a class environment that is welcoming and conducive to learning.
  2. Provide meaningful (read: not busywork) assignments.
  3. Teach you something about computer science, programming, computational thinking and other cool stuff.
