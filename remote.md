#### Rundown:
* Regular HW assignments will be posted & handeled in the normal manner. The time due will change to 10am.
* Regular assignments will continue to be graded for effort, not correctness/quality.
* By Wednesday, a longer lab assignment will be posted, it will be due by 10am the following Monday. This assignment will be graded for correctness/quality.
* Lessons will be posted on this website. They may include small exercises to follow along with. Those exercieses do not need to be submitted.
* Every day, during the normal class time (2:10 - 2:50 or 1:30 - 2:05 on Wednesdays), I will be available on the class slack workspace (see below for more information) to hold a text-based discussion.
* Outside of class time, all questions should be handled using the class QAF (also see below).
* Participation in slack and QAF discussions, as well as in the weekly zoom check ins will be recorded.
* Thursday and Friday I will hold small zoom meetings with groups of 6 students. These meetings should take about 10 minutes. I've gone ahead and assigned groups based on your seats in class, below find the meeting schedule. Groups assignments can be found [further below](#zoom-group-assignments)
* I know many of you have various responsibilities and may not be able to make some of these class time discussions. That is totally ok, and why we have the QAF as well. You can still be a part of the community and contribute around your schedule.
* If you have concerns about anything, or have issues with using the systems set in place, please email me. We can work this out, but only if you let me know something is up.

#### Overview & Methodology

Given our current reality I've had to do a lot of re-thinking of what things like _class_, _instruction_ and _assessment_ mean. I believe the decision to close schools was the right one, but I’m not happy about it. I enjoy coming to work, seeing you all daily, working with students. One thing that is of vital importance is that __remote instruction depends on participation__. I will do everything I can to make it easy to participate, but _you need to act_. Here are the big questions that I have been working on:

  0. How can I provide information/lessons/notes to you?
  1. How can I facilitate discussion?
  2. How can I assess your progress? The class’ progress?

The goals of our class remain the same: to further our programming and computational thinking ability; to learn the python programming language; to be able to develop programs that merge python and web development. Here is how we will be working through the big questions listed above:


  1. __How can I provide information/lessons/notes to you?__
   * First off, everything you need will always be accessible through the class website.
   * I think it is of vital importance that I provide you with access to materials that can be publicly visible on the internet without the need for signing into an account.
   * You will notice a new section of the web page titled “Lessons”. It will contain web versions of the slides that I use in class. Over time this may evolve, but right now it will allow me to get those lessons to you quickly.

  2. __How can I facilitate discussion?__
   * This is a big change. We aren’t meeting in the same room every day, and I understand that some of you may not be available at the same time every day in order to meet virtually.
   * We will have 2 means of discussion: one for real-time, [synchronous](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/synchronous){:target="_blank"} discussion; and one for [asynchronous](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/asynchronous){:target="_blank"}, long term discussion.
   * During normal class hours, you will be able to find me parked at our shiny new [slack workspace](https://introcs-dw.slack.com/){:target="_blank"}. While you read through the day's lesson, assignment, or both, use the slack channel to have a conversation with me and your classmates.
   * The [Class QAF](https://groups.google.com/a/stuy.edu/forum/#!forum/dw-intro2-qaf){:target="_blank"} will be a vital resource. This is where any discussions should occur outside of class hours. It is also where we can have richer interactions. I will be checking the QAF frequently, and requesting you all to use it more while doing assignments. It is also likely for questions that come up in the slack workspace during class will end up becoming QAF posts.
   * __We are a class community, and these community resources will only be as good as we all are at using them.__

  2. __How can we assess your progress? The class’ progress?__
   * There will still be assignments like the ones you are used to. They will be posted in the same place and you will submit them the same way. These will be evaluated as they have been: you get credit as long as you show you worked on it, regardless of how well you did.
   * There will also be longer lab-style assignments (like the efficiency and rot13 labs). Most likely once a week. These will be evaluated based on the quality of your work. These labs will take the place of exams until we return. Yes, there will not be any exams until we’re back in school together.
   * I will also be keeping track of your activity in the slack workspace and on the QAF. It is of the utmost importances that you understand QUALITY is better than QUANTITY. If you help to further discussions, I will know, and you will be credited for your work.

You are now in much more control of your education than you were a week ago. This is a unique opportunity, and you can let it go, or you can use it to expand your educational capabilities. I expect you all to rise to the occasion because I know you can. I will endeavor to support you in this journey as best I can.
